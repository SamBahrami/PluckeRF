Code to be released.

## Overview

**PlückeRF** is a novel line-based 3D representation for few-view reconstruction that more effectively harnesses multi-view information. 

**Key Contributions:**
- **PlückeRF Representation**: A structured, feature-augmented line-based 3D representation that connects pixel rays from input views
- **Enhanced Multi-view Information Sharing**: Preferential information sharing between nearby 3D locations and between 3D locations and nearby pixel rays
- **Superior Performance**: Demonstrated improvements in reconstruction quality over equivalent triplane representations and state-of-the-art feedforward reconstruction methods
